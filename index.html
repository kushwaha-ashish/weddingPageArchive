				<h1>Our <span id="amp">S</span>tory</h1>
				<p style><b>The Beginning</b></p>
				<b>In the fall of 2011, Ashish and Sara arrived at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, U.S.A. Ashish had gotten his degree in Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, and was ready to start pursuing a Ph.D. in the same field. Sara had just graduated from Thomas Aquinas College, CA (a “Great Books” liberal arts college), and was ready to shift from studying philosophy and theology to chemical engineering.
				<br>

				<br>Sara and Ashish disagree on the exact date of when they met, but they know it was due to the class Material Science and Engineering. Sara and one of her study partners would email Ashish questions from time to time. Sara and Ashish’s email conversations expanded, from the difference between eutectic and eutectoid points to life in general. The quote from the movie “You’ve got Mail” probably sums things up the best: “I go online, and my breath catches in my chest until I hear three little words: You've got mail.”<br>

				<br>The emails extended to personal meetings and lunches, and four years and one engagement ring later, we (yes, "we" started talking in first person all of a sudden) are getting married. We hope that you will all be able to celebrate with us!</b>

					Ashish is a Chemical Engineering doctorate student at the University of Notre Dame. Sometimes he is forced to write about himself in the third person. Some other times, he pretends to exercise. Rest of the time, he makes wedding websites.

					Sara is a Process Engineer. Sometimes she forces others to write about themselves in the third person. Since the text about the girl should always be bigger than that about the guy on a wedding website, let's put some random text here. But we still failed. Oh wait...
